<h2>Summary's for 10 modulars:</h2>
<h4>Algorithms, what i learned and what ill continue to use:</h4>
<p>From the algorithms program I learned things like, different types of sorting like quick sort, merge sort, etc.<br>Other important things i learned include binary search, which is an effective searching method that halves the search space each time, as well as asymptotic notation, which teaches how to describe the efficiency of an algorithm and asymptotic notation, big O, big Theta and big Omega, which are used to more precisely describe the efficiency.<br>The main thing I will continue to use from the algorithms course is the graph representation section, which teaches useful concepts that can be used in real life such as, describing and representing graphs.</p>

<h4>Intro to JS, what i learned and what ill continue to use:</h4>
<p>Intro to JS was my favourite program that I did on khan academy, not just because it was fun but it expanded on the limited knowledge I had of JS and went more in depth and fully taught me things I had general ideas of like, drawing, colouring, variales, functions, looping, if statements, objects, and arrays.<br>Some new things i was introduced to or learned more of that i barley had an understanding of include, debugging (different then I previously knew), making programs animated and interactable, further explaing on why its important to write clean code, and finally object-oriented design which was the hardest but also very useful.<br>I'd use most of what i learned from this section in the future, in my opinion what I belive is the most important aspects are, drawing, variables, interactive programs, functions, if statements, looping, arrays, and of course object-oriented design.</p>

<h4>Intro to HTML/CSS, what i learned and what ill continue to use:</h4>
<p>Intro to HTML/CSS was the first course I took on khan academy and taught me the basics that I used in courses later on such as making webpages interactive.<br>This course taught me amny things on format and styling, important concepts it taught include, selecting by id and class, creating links, and the biggest thing styling pages.<br>Styling is the main thing this course taught and in the future styling is what id continue to use, there are many specifics under "styling" I would use but since there are so many id just say the concept of styling is what id have in the back of my mind for later.</p>
