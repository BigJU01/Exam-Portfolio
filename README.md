<h2>Summary's for 10 modulars:</h2>
<h4>Algorithms</h4>
<p>From the algorithms program I learned things like, different types of sorting like quick sort, merge sort, etc.<br>Most important aspect I learned binary search, which is an effective searching method that halves the search space each time, as well as asymptotic notation, which teaches how to describe the efficiency of an algorithm and asymptotic notation, big O, big Theta and big Omega, which are used to more precisely describe the efficiency.<br>The main thing I will continue to use from the algorithms course is the graph representation section, which teaches useful concepts that can be used in real life such as, describing and representing graphs.</p>

<h4>Intro to JS</h4>
<p>Intro to JS was my favourite program that I did on khan academy, not just because it was fun but it expanded on the limited knowledge I had of JS and went more in depth and fully taught me things I had general ideas of like, drawing, colouring, variales, functions, looping, if statements, objects, and arrays.<br>Some new things i was introduced to or learned more of that i barley had an understanding of include, debugging (different then I previously knew), making programs animated and interactable, further explaing on why its important to write clean code, and finally object-oriented design which had the most signifficant impact and was the hardest but also very useful, along with being useful its a very important aspect of programming to comphrehend so to me its the most signifficant becuase of how useful and versatile it is.<br>I'd use most of what i learned from this section in the future, in my opinion what I belive is the most important aspects are, drawing, variables, interactive programs, functions, if statements, looping, arrays, and of course object-oriented design.</p>

<h4>Intro to HTML/CSS</h4>
<p>Intro to HTML/CSS was the first course I took on khan academy and taught me the basics that I used in courses later on such as making webpages interactive.<br>This course taught me many things on format and styling, important concepts it taught include, selecting by id and class, creating links, and the most impactful thing was styling pages, shows off cretiveness, unique to the individual, and makes it pop to attract and intice viewers.<br>Styling is the main thing this course taught and in the future styling is what id continue to use, there are many specifics under "styling" I would use but since there are so many id just say the concept of styling is what id have in the back of my mind for later.</p>

<h4>Intro to SQL</h4>
<p>Intro to SQL basically taught organizing and inserting data into tables. It taught many things that have to do with presenting data in tables including aggregating data, querying in subqueries, joining related tabs, combining joins, an important one changining rows with update and delete, etc. The most signifficant one in my opinion though would be calculating results with CASE, which is like an if statement essentially arranges data in a table based on what conditions are met. There are 2 main things id try to rememeber to use in future years and that would be reults with CASE because i belive it is really intresting and useful for finding specifics in a large quantity of data and changing rows with update and delete, just because its really useful, some lines of code that alter your current data tables to highlight specifc things that the user wants.</p>

<h4>Games and visualizations</h4>
<p>Games and visualizations was to me the funniest course, I got into computers because I wanted to design games so this course is suited perfectly for me. The projects were very enjoyable, a card matching game and a game that resembles flappy bird almost. things the course taught interactive and animating scenes, programming buttons, rotating and scaling, 3D shapes, and collisions just to name a few. I found 2 really signifficant programming buttons and collisions, those 2 me were the most signifficant because I belive those are fundamentals of games which is important to me if I end up designing games. All games have buttons that do something or collisions or both. Buttons are important because it allows the game to work, programming different keys or actions that corraspond to a command in the game allows for creativity and more functions for the game. Collisions are important for games because its almost like a condition like in Mario when Mario jumps on a Goomba that is essentially 2 objexts colliding, now if you didint use collision programming there nothing would happen, thats why its important because it uses condtions on objects (like how Mario hits a Goomba above: goomba dies, any other direction of contact: Mario dies) to allow for different outcomes. Thats why those 2 aspects are ones id want to keep in mind, espically if I get into to game design.</p>

<h4>Natural Simulations</h4>
<p>Natural Simulations was the hardest course for me, the concepts took me a while to understand and apply. The course had a lot of concepts that help in real life as well that made for some very intresting simulations. concepts that help in real life (mainlly physics) include, noise, vectors, forces, angular movement, and oscillations, these expand on concepts touched in physics. concepts that made in my opinion intresting simulations, randomness, angular movement (specifically falling boulder and turning car (teaches important concepts to)) oscillations (specifically spaceship ride, many waves, and pendulum puppet) and particle systems (specifically fish bubbles, fire starter (coolest in my opinion), and river rocks). The most signifficant concepts and ones id want to continue using are all the previously mentioned concepts that help in real life mainly physics. This is because they have multiple purposes (programming and real life applications), there physics concepts so they apply to life so they are important to comprehend, and lastly because im trying to become a computer programming I will be taking physics courses so understanding the materail is key for me.</p>

<h4>Making webpages interactive</h4>
<p>Making webpages interactive was a very intresting course it had no projects but a lot of useful concepts. The most signifficant concept was DOM as a whole, the course revolved around using JS to control DOM (Document Object Model). teaching things like DOM access methods, DOM modification, DOM events and DOM animation, all key tools for making an interactive webpage. What id like to take from this course and use in the future is not a specific concept but the connection between JS and DOM, id like to remember how they relate so I can apply the DOM concepts and make interactive webpages, which I belive is a great skill. So by remembering the basis of how the 2 connect I can use that as a foundation to remember how to apply the rest of what I learned about DOM properties.</p>

<h4>Making webpages interactive with jQuery</h4>
<p>Making webpages interactive with jQuery expands on what was learned in "Making webpages interactive". It introduces a new concept jQuery and teaches you how to use it and CSS selectors to access the DOM. Overall it teaches you to access the previously mentioned DOM properties (DOM access methods, DOM modification, DOM events and DOM animation) with jQuery. Since most of the course is an expansion on the previous I found the most signiffcant lesson to be jQuery techniques, since it isint an expansion but a fully new concept. The other lessons show an alternate way of accessing the DOM this lesson shows the usefulness and uniqueness of jQuery, so it gives a real insight into why youd use it in cases as opposed to JS (previous section). For the the future id like to remember JQuery as a whole, not all the concepts and uses but remember that it is an alternate way to make webages interactive.
